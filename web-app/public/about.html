      <p>A customer loyalty program allows companies to reward customers who frequently make purchases. Program members are able to earn points on purchases, which can translate into some type of reward such as discount, freebie or special customer treatment.
        The members work toward a certain amount of points to redeem their reward. These programs can have multiple companies as partners on the program, to cater to a customer base. However, current loyalty program systems are restraint on relations
        between partners, and with visibility to members. These restraints can be removed by creating the customer loyalty program on a blockchain network.
        <br><br> This blockchain model for a customer loyalty program enhances the value of points to loyalty program members and brings in new value to the partners by creating trusted transactions. Participants in this network have a more level relation
        among each other and points are in the centric position to connect all participants.
        <br><br> In this code pattern, we will create a customer loyalty program as a blockchain web application using Hyperledger Composer API and Node.js. The application will allow members to register on the network where they will create their account.
        They will be identified on the network with their account number and will create a access key which they will use to sign in. This access key is used as the card id for the member to make transactions and query records. The member once signed
        in, can make transactions to earn points and redeem points from the partners on the network. They can view their transactions as part of the blockchain ledger. This code pattern illustrates the use of permissions as part of the network where a
        member can only view their transactions.
        <br><br> Similarly for the partner, they will register by creating an identity on the network and an access key which will be used to view their records. Partners are allowed to view only transactions they were part of, and thus can keep track
        of all their transactions where they allocated or redeemed points. The web application shows a basic dashboard for the partner displaying the total points that they have allocated and redeemed to members. As transactions get complex, the partner
        can perform analysis on their transactions to create informative dashboards.
